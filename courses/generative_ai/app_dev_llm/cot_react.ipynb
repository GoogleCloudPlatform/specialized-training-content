        "Zero-shot chain of thought is when you add a \"trigger sentence\" to the end of your LLM call. For example, \"let's think step by step\", \"start by taking a deep breath\", or \"SOLUTION:\". It is a fast and easy way to increase prompt performance and is flexible to different tasks (whereas few-shot chain of thought requires your question resemble the exemplars).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, zero-shot chain of thought underperforms few-shot in almost all situations. Additionally, zero-shot chain of thought requires calling the LLM twice--once to generate the response, and again to extract the  answer from the response (since you don't have exemplars showing the response structure). Finally, zero-shot chain-of-thought has a tendency to restate a question rather than answering it.\n",

        "\n",
        "You must follow these best practices to get the good performance from chain of thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Don't** Use a small LLM.\n",
        "  * Ideally, use an LLM with at least 15B parameters.\n",
        "  * Expect techniques like distillation and improved LLM architectures to eventually change this advice.\n",
        "1. **Do** Put the answer _after_ the chain-of-thought reasoning, not before.\n",
        "1. **Do** Set [temperature](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart#try_text_prompts) to 0.\n",
        "1. **Do** Use few-shot chain of thought, not just one-shot or zero-shot.\n",
        "1. **Do** Write exemplars that include everything you would say when talking through the reasoning step-by-step.\n",
        "  * Chain of thought requires natural language reasoning.\n",
        "  * **Don't** Use math equations in place of natural language reasoning. Adding equations to supplement natural language is fine.\n",
        "1. **Don't** Assume chain of thought stops hallucinations.\n",
        " * Chain of thought improves an LLM's ability to reason, but does not stop an LLM from making up facts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "More tips to get the most from chain of thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Don't** Overfocus on the order of few-shot exemplars, it's unlikely to change performance.\n",
        "  * Classification tasks are one exception, don't have too many exeplars of the same class back-to-back.\n",
        "1. **Do** Analyze where your chain-of-thought prompt fails, then craft additional few-shot exemplars to manage common failures.\n",
        "1. **Don't** Write more than six few-shot exemplars to start. Only some tasks  benefit from more.\n",
        "1. **Do** Have multiple prompt engineers each attempt to write the best prompt.\n",
        "  * For example, if you have three tasks to write prompts for and three prompt engineers, anecdotally you'll get better results if each prompt engineer writes prompts for all three tasks vs. each prompt engineer working three times as long on a prompt for a single task.\n",
        "1. **Don't** Expect chain of thought to improve results if your task requires only one or two reasoning steps.\n",
        "1. **Don't** Worry too much about exactly matching the number of reasoning steps in your exemplars vs. your task.\n",
        " * The style or structure of reasoning is more important to match.\n",
        " * There is performance benefit if you _can_ match the number of reasoning steps, but if you can't chain of thought still provides a performance boost.\n",
        "1. **Do** Add chains of thought when tuning an LLM.\n",
        "  * You can prompt an LLM to generate chain-of-thought reasoning from a question and answer, and then add the reasoning to the responses in the tuning data.\n",
        "  * Prompting vs. tuning is a false dichotomy--you'll get the best tuned model performance when tuning data inputs include a well-engineered prompt.\n",
        "1. **Do** Include exemplars that match your data distribution.\n",
        " * For example, if your data is 80% class A and 20% class B and you write 5 few-shot exemplars, 4 exemplars should be class A and 1 should be class B.\n",
        " * With classification tasks the exemplar order can matter, but matching the class distribution increases order robustness.\n",
        " * **Do** make sure not too many back-to-back exemplars are the same class."

        "1. **Do** Use `temperature=.7`, `top_k=40`, `top_p=1`, and 10 responses as a starting point.\n",

        " * **Do** Find optimal values for production use cases by conducting a hyperparameter search.\n",
        "   * Note that it's likely much more valuable to search on the response count than the LLM parameters, and if you do experiment with LLM parameters it's usually not worth reducing them much.\n",
        "1. **Do** Try self-consistency early if your initial prompt engineering attempts fail.\n",
        " * Self-consistency is more likely to boost performance than continuing to engineer your chain of thought prompt.  \n",
        "1. **Don't** Ignore cost and latency implications.\n",
        "1. **Do** Parallelize LLM calls to reduce execution time.\n",
        " * **Don't** Put off assessing the LLM throughput and latency your self-consistency use case requires.\n",
        "1. **Do** Use response distributions in creative ways. For example:\n",
        " * If fewer than X percent of answers match, flag the question for human review.\n",
        " * Generate multiple summaries and use a text similarity metric to identify which generated summary is most \"average\".\n",
        "1. **Do** Use self-consistency to inspire few-shot exemplars and to debug your prompt."

        "\n",
        "The basic pattern for LLM tool use is:\n",
        "1. Make a first LLM call describing:\n",
        " * i: The task you want completed.\n",
        " * ii: An external  system.\n",
        " * iii: How to formulate a call to the external system.\n",
        "2. Call the external system using the response generated by the LLM.\n",
        "3. Make a second LLM call that includes the response from the external system, along with instructions for the LLM to complete the original task using the response from the external system.\n",
        "\n",
        "If our LLM system is supposed to answer fact-based questions like the Chancellor example above:\n",
        "1. The first LLM call directs the LLM to generate a search query for a knowledge base.\n",
        "2. The LLM's response is used to query the knowledge base, and the result of the query is captured.\n",
        "3. The second LLM call includes the result of the knowledge base query, the original question, and instructions for the LLM to answer the question using the result from the knowledge base query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM's tool can be many things--a database, a web search, a document retrieval system, etc. Part of the LLM system is the code integrating the LLM with the external information source.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll use Wikipedia as an external information source and build a basic LLM system to answer fact-based questions. Our LLM system will:\n",
        "1. Call an LLM to generate a Wikipedia search query.\n",
        "1. Call the Wikipedia API to retrieve the query result.\n",
        "1. Call the LLM again with the Wikipedia API response plus the original question.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the scope of this notebook, LLMs can be called with instructinos describing more than one tool. The LLM both selects the tool and formulates the call to the tool. And LLM tools don't have to be read-only, you can use a tool to interact with an external system (though please consider the ethics and fairness implications--just because you *can* use an LLM to automate an activity doesn't mean you *should*. Hallucinations are annoying when you want to do something like generate a summary, but can be devastating when making a decision that impacts someone's life. Even applications as seemingly innocent as automated paper grading can lead to model failures negatively impacting someone's life)."

        "\n",
        "If you experimented with the prompts above, you probably experienced failures. In many cases, this is because of the limited Wikipedia tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following some best practices will help you build more robust and effective tools than in this teaching example.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Do** Clearly describe the tool and how to use it in the prompt.\n",
        " * This includes few-shot exemplars demonstrating ideal tool use.\n",
        " * For example, a tool described as \"doc search\" will underperform vs. the same tool described as \"Search internal documents with a natural language query. The response is a list of document names ordered by descending relevancy to the query.\"\n",
        "1. **Do** Carefully consider the scope and complexity of your tools.\n",
        " * **Do** Think through if the API to your tool is simple enough for an LLM to use.\n",
        " * Often multiple simple tools will work better than one complex tool. What a developer sees as a single API may work better as multiple LLM tools.\n",
        " * For example, if your use case requires running SQL to access a database, consider a few separate SQL templates as individual tools vs. using the LLM to generate SQL queries from scratch.\n",
        "1. **Do** Keep the tool output structurally and stylistically consistent.\n",
        " * The less variation in the tool output the more likely the LLM uses the output effectively.\n",
        "1. **Do** Keep tool output short and relevant.\n",
        " * Wordy tool outputs can stress the LLM input length limit.\n",
        " * One great example is the [ReAct paper's Wikipedia agent implementation](https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct/blob/master/wikienv.py), which includes searching within a Wikipedia article and then only returns a snippet of text around the found term rather than the full article.\n",
        "1. **Do** Handle failures gracefully.\n",
        " * **Do** Catch exceptions and provide useful error messages.\n",
        " * **Do** Manage tool malfunctions like timeouts and rate limits.\n",
        " * **Do** Show error handling in your exemplars.\n",
        "    * If a tool fails and you provide a useful error in the next LLM call, the LLM may self-correct.\n",
        "1. **Do** Tune tool usage prompts.\n",
        " * A parameter-efficient tuning set with a  variety of tool usage (even only 10s of examples) can improve performance significantly.\n",
        "1. **Do** Limit the output length when calling an LLM to generate a tool action.\n",
        " * The LLM will continue generating text beyond the tool action.\n",
        "1. **Don't** Forget about security. Many tool usage patterns create security risks.\n",
        " * **Do** Assume anything accessible via an LLM's tools will be seen by end users experimenting with adversarial inputs.\n",
        " * **Don't** assume your LLM's tool calls will never be malicious. For example, [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) is possible via an LLM tool.\n",

Its central character, psychology professor Peter Boyd (Reagan), tries to teach human morals to a chimpanzee, hoping to solve the \"nature versus nurture\" question. Boyd hires Jane Linden (Lynn) to pose as the chimpanzee's mother while he plays father to it and uses 1950s-era child-rearing techniques.A sequel was released titled Bonzo Goes to College (1952), but it featured none of the three lead performers from the original film. Peggy, who had also appeared in My Friend Irma Goes West (1950), died in a fire on March 4, 1951, so another chimpanzee was hired for the second film. Reagan did not want to appear in the second film as he thought that the premise was unbelievable.\n",

Released in 1986, songs on this album cover common punk subjects often found in punk rock lyrics of the era such as conformity, Reaganomics, the U.S. military, and critique of the hardcore punk movement. The album's title refers to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan and also reflects the band's weary bitterness from the trial they were undergoing at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. By the time recording of Bedtime for Democracy had begun, the Dead Kennedys had already played what would be their last concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the release of the record, whose opening track is a cover of David Allan Coe's \"Take This Job and Shove It.\"\n",
