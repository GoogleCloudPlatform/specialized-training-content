    "# Generating Primary Keys for Spanner\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spanner databases, using monotonically increasing or decreasing primary keys is a potential performance problem. This is especially true for large databases with a lot of inserts. \n",
    " \n",
    "The best primary key is a natural key. This is where you choose two or more fields in the database that guarantee uniqueness. Just make sure the natural key doesn't always get larger (or smaller).\n",
    " \n",
    "Sometimes a surrogate key is required. Traditionally, developers have used counters as surrogate primary keys. This is inefficient in Spanner. Spanner also has no built-in key generators, so it's up to the client, not the server, to generate the key.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are several ways to generate surrogate keys. This notebook explore them. \n"

    "UUIDs are 36-bit strings guaranteed to be unique. There are different versions of UUIDs, so you must be careful. Version 1 UUIDs are generated with a timestamp. These always get larger, thus, should not be used for Spanner keys.\n",

    "Version 4 UUIDs are generated using random numbers. These do not increase monotonically. The code below uses Python to generate 10 UUID strings. Notice the values do not continually get bigger. They are randomly distributed across the table space in a Spanner database, which is what you want. \n"

Because there are so many potential hashed values, it is extraordinarily unlikely that two different inputs would result in the same hashed value. Hashing works with any data type.
