title: "Migrating Snowflake Users to BigQuery"
description: In this course you will learn how to translate various concepts in Snowflake to the analogous concepts in BigQuery. You will learn how the high-level architectures of Snowflake and BigQuery compare, understand differences in how to configure datasets and tables, map data types in Snowflake to data types in BigQuery, understand schema mapping from Snowflake to BigQuery, optimize your new schemas in BigQuery, and do a high-level comparison of SQL dialects in Snowflake and BigQuery.
objectives: 
audience: 'Current users of Snowflake (Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Application Developers) migrating to BigQuery'
prerequisites: 'Some basic Snowflake and BigQuery experience is assumed.'
