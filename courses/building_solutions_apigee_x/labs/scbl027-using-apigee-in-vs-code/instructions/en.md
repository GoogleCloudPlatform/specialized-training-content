# Using Apigee in VS Code

## Overview

In this lab, you use an open source version of VS Code in the browser (Code-Server). You install Google's Cloud Code, the Apigee local development environment and Apigee Emulator, and use it to build and test a simple local proxy before deploying it to Apigee for testing.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to:
- Install Cloud Code for VS Code
- Develop a local API proxy
- Emulate an Apigee environment
- Deploy a local API to Apigee

## Task 0. Provison LAB resources 

1. Navigate to the the Google Cloud console at **https://console.cloud.google.com**.

2. Click Activate Cloud Shell (Activate Cloud Shell icon) in the top menu to open Cloud Shell

3.  To ensure that you are in the Cloud Shell home directory, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    cd ~ 
    ```

4. In Cloud Shell, confirm the default compute zone is set to the zone used by the gateway VM.

    <ql-code-block templated>
    gcloud config set compute/zone {{{project_0.default_zone|vm_zone}}}
    </ql-code-block>

5. Clone the class repository and move into the repository root folder.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fabltd/Apigee-utils
    cd Apigee-utils
    ```

    <ql-infobox>
    The following step runs a script that provisons the VS Code server enviroment
    </ql-infobox>

6. Create a VM and install VS Code Server.

   ```bash
    ./setup/install/lab7/install.sh
    ```

7. When promoted to generate a key press **y** and then press the **enter** key twice this will generate your ssh keys

7. Wait for the script to complete and you should see - Done !!!!

## Task 1. Set up your environment

1. In the Google Cloud console, from the Navigation menu (![Navigation menu icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/images/menu.png)), select __Compute Engine and VM instances__.

2. In the Compute Engine VM instances pane, locate the VM named __vs-code-server__ and click the **SSH** button.

    <ql-infobox>
    The <strong>vs-code-server</strong> virtual machine is an Ubuntu instance that hosts an installation of Virtual Studio Code for the sake of this lab. You can also explore the use of Cloud Code with Cloud Workstations or local installations of Virtual Studio Code.
    
    </ql-infobox>

3. When the prompt changes indicating that you are connected to the gateway, execute the following command. Note that the previos script you executed in Cloud Shell must be finished to receive the correct output.

    ```bash
    curl 127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

4. Verify that the output is similar to this.

    ```bash
    Found. Redirecting to ./login
    ```

    <ql-infobox>
    This confirms that your VS Code server is running.    
    </ql-infobox>


5. To close the SSH session, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    Exit 
    ```

6. Return to the Google Cloud console and click **Activate Cloud Shell** (![Activate Cloud Shell icon](images/activate_shell.png)) in the top menu to open Cloud Shell.

7. In Cloud Shell, confirm the default compute zone is set to the zone used by the gateway VM.

    <ql-code-block templated>
    gcloud config set compute/zone {{{project_0.default_zone|vm_zone}}}
    </ql-code-block>


8. To ensure that you are in the Cloud Shell home directory, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

9. To clone the class repository and move into the repository root folder, execute the following commands.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Apigee-utils
    ```

    <ql-infobox>
    The virtual machine is not exposed to the internet. It can be accessed via the SSH functionality of gcloud that provides a reverse proxy Shell.
    </ql-infobox>

10. To connect to the server, execute the following command that uses a helper script to start the reverse proxy. 

    ```bash
    ./student-scripts/proxy.sh
    ```

11. Verify that the output is similar to the following.

    ```bash
    Setup SSH Tunnel
    ```

    </ql-infobox>


## Task 5. Configure Apigee

You have successfully tested that the proxy works in your development environment. You now want to publish your API to Apigee. API proxies developed in Cloud Code need a different Apigee configuration to work in Apigee itself.

1. In a separate browser tab from Google Cloud console, open the Apigee console at [console.cloud.google.com/apigee](https://console.cloud.google.com/apigee/).

    Alternatively, to open the Apigee console from the Google Cloud console Navigation menu (![Navigation menu icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/images/menu.png)), select **Tools > Apigee**.
    
2. To add a new Apigee environment, navigate to **Management > Environments* and click  **+ Create Environment**.

3. Complete the dialog as follows and click **Create**.

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **dev** |
    | Display name | **dev** |
    | Instance | **apigee-tf-inst** |
    | Development type | **Archive** |

    <ql-infobox>
    Your configuration should resemble the following.
    </ql-infobox>

    ![environment configuration](images/newenv.png)

    <ql-infobox>
    The dev environment needs to be added to an Environment Group to allow for incoming traffic.
    </ql-infobox>

4. To add **dev** to an Environment Group, navigate to **Management > Environments** and click on **Environment Groups** and click on the actions (three-dot) menu and select **Edit** for the **test-env-group** Environment group.

5. Locate the **Environments** panel at the bottom of the page.

6. Select **dev** and click the tick box then click **Ok** followed by **Update**

    <ql-infobox>
    The dev environment also needs to be added to a runtime instance this should have been done when we created the new environment. 
    </ql-infobox>

7. To check the **dev** runtime instance, navigate to **Management > Instances** and click **apigee-tf-inst**.

8.  Verify you see **test-env** and **dev**. If dev is missing you can click **edit** and add dev to the environments section.

    ![eval-instance dialog](images/instance.png)

9. To obtain your **APIGEE_URL**, select **Management > Environments** click on **Environment Groups** and then **test-env-group** and make a note of the hostname that ends with **nip.io**.

    ![host name](images/hostname.png)

    <ql-infobox>
    This hostname is requried in the next task. Make sure to record the value.
    </ql-infobox>


## Task 6. Upload the proxy

1. Return to your VS Cloud Cloud window.

2. Locate **Compute Engine** in the Cloud Code navigation window and click **Select a project**.

    ![select project](images/select.png)

3. You are prompted to enter a project. Do **not** enter any value.

4. Click the **Sign In** button (![sign in icon](images/signicon.png)). 

    ![sign in](images/signin.png)

5. Click **Proceed to sign in**. 

    <ql-infobox>
    A new tab appears in the VS Code terminal, with a link to retrieve a code, and a prompt to enter the retrieved authorization code.
    </ql-infobox>

6. Copy the long URL from the terminal and paste into a new tab in your Incognito window. 

Example URL:

    ```bash
    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=32555940559.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsdk.cloud.google.com%2Fauthcode.html&scope=openid+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fappengine.admin+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fsqlservice.login+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcompute+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Faccounts.reauth&state=T4gQznHqaGGbrW7sXI0KVMYRDdx4Sc&prompt=consent&access_type=offline&code_challenge=_kZYm2_cbt8s6PooeyPKJPXsQR_zNttzPQwhPeCjhqw&code_challenge_method=S256
    ```

7. When prompted, select your student account.

    ![select student](images/student.png)

8. Allow Cloud SDK access and then click **copy** in the **Sign in to the gcloud CLI** page.

9. Return to the VS Code terminal and paste the copied string into the prompt. If Chrome prompts you to allow the clipboard, select **Allow**.

10. Press **Enter**, wait for authorization to complete and then Press **Enter** again to exit the terminal tab.

11. Return to the prompt to enter a project and select your **qwiklabs-gcp-xxxxx** project. 

12. In the VS Code terminal, execute the following.

    ```
    gcloud beta apigee archives deploy --environment=dev
    ```

13. Verify that your output resembles the following.

    ```
    Waiting for operation [6e9816cb-06e1-4554-bd00-d2af6ac2b320] to complete...  
    ```

14.  Locate the **APIGEE_URL** value you noted above. Execute the following command, replacing **APIGEE_URL** with your value. 

```
curl https://APIGEE_URL/v1/demo ; echo
```

<ql-infobox>
Note: <strong>; echo</strong> ensures the result is on a newline in the terminal.
</ql-infobox>

**Example command**

```
curl https://34.149.141.95.nip.io/v1/demo; echo
```

**Expected output**

```
Hello, Guest!
```


### **Congratulations!** You have deployed a local Cloud Code for a VS Code development environment, tested your proxy and deployed to Apigee. This workflow allows for proxies to be integrated with CI/CD workflows as the code can and should be checked into a Git repository.
